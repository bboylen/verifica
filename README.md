# Verifica

Verifica is Ruby's most scalable authorization solution, designed to support sophisticated authorization rules.
It works whether you have 10 or 10M records in the database. It works with any framework and any database.
Verifica is just a plain Ruby, zero dependencies, and no magic.

**Note: Verifica is under active development. The first public release, docs, and examples are coming soon.**
